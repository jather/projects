        <h2>Short Biography</h2>
        <p>Lee Morgan (Edward Lee Morgan) was an American Jazz trumpeter and composer, known as one of the greatest musicians of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_bop">hard bop</a>. </p>
        <p>Morgan was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in July 10, 1938. He was already performing professionally by the age of 15. In 1956 (when he was 18) he joined Dizzie Gillespie's big band, and after it was disbanded, joined Art Blakey's Jazz Messengers in 1958. There he would record many albums with the Messengers, including <em>Moanin'</em>, one of the band's most well known recordings. </p>
        <p>He would record prolifically from 1956 until his death in 1972, becoming a cornerstone of the Blue Note label. He recorded 25 albums for Blue Note as a leader, and featured in many others, frequently recording with Hank Mobley and Wayne Shorter. In 1961, Morgan was forced to leave the Jazz Messengers due to his heroin addiction, and returned to Philadelphia.</p>
        <p> In 1963, he came back with <em>Sidewinder</em>, which was a huge commercial success that may have saved the struggling Blue Note from bankruptcy. He continued recording prolifically in the 60's, and in the last two years of his life became more politically involved, becoming one of the leaders of the Jazz and People's movement. </p>        
        <p>Lee morgan was killed in February 19, 1972, 33 years of age, in a jazz club in New York City where he was performing. He was shot by his common-law wife Helen Moore, bleeding to death as the ambulance was slow to arrive.
